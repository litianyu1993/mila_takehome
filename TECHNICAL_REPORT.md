## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive enhancement of the baseline image-caption alignment model for CIFAR-100 paired images. The implementation transforms the original Jupyter notebook into a production-ready, modular codebase with significant architectural improvements, advanced training strategies, and comprehensive evaluation capabilities. The enhanced model achieves improved performance through a larger Vision Transformer architecture, sophisticated data augmentation, and optimized training procedures.

## 1. Methodology and Motivation

### 1.1 Problem Formulation

The challenge involves aligning paired CIFAR-100 images with their corresponding captions using contrastive learning. Each training sample consists of:
- **Input**: Two horizontally stacked CIFAR-100 images (3, 32, 64)
- **Target**: Caption in format "the photo on the left is {class1} and the photo on the right is {class2}"
- **Objective**: Learn shared embedding space where matching image-caption pairs have high similarity

### 1.2 Baseline Analysis

The original baseline implementation featured:
- **Image Encoder**: 1-layer Vision Transformer (512 dim, 1 head, 1024 MLP)
- **Text Encoder**: Frozen CLIP ViT-Base (512 dim output)
- **Training**: Basic Adam optimizer, 4 epochs, minimal augmentation
- **Performance**: Top-1: 0.24%, Top-10: 1.69%, Top-100: 10.97%

### 1.3 Enhancement Strategy

#### 1.3.1 Architectural Improvements

**Enhanced Vision Transformer:**
- **Scale**: 6 layers (vs 1), 8 attention heads (vs 1), 2048 MLP dimension (vs 1024)
- **Architecture**: Pre-norm design with residual connections for better gradient flow
- **Activation**: GELU activation function (vs ReLU) for improved transformer performance
- **Initialization**: Xavier uniform initialization for better training stability
- **Rationale**: Larger models with better architecture can learn more complex visual representations

**Key Architectural Changes:**
```python
# Original: 1 layer, 1 head, 1024 MLP
ImageTransformerEncoder(embed_dim=512, num_layers=1, num_heads=1, mlp_dim=1024)

# Enhanced: 6 layers, 8 heads, 2048 MLP
EnhancedImageTransformerEncoder(embed_dim=512, num_layers=6, num_heads=8, mlp_dim=2048)
```

#### 1.3.2 Training Enhancements

**Advanced Optimization:**
- **Optimizer**: AdamW with weight decay (0.01) for better generalization
- **Learning Rate**: 1e-3 with cosine annealing and 2-epoch warmup
- **Scheduling**: Cosine annealing reduces learning rate smoothly over training
- **Gradient Clipping**: Prevents exploding gradients (norm=1.0)
- **Temperature**: Optimized contrastive loss temperature (0.07)

**Data Augmentation Pipeline:**
- **Horizontal Flip**: 50% probability for geometric invariance
- **Color Jitter**: Brightness, contrast, saturation (0.2 strength)
- **Rotation**: ±10 degrees for rotational robustness
- **Sampling Strategy**: 50% chance of different class pairs for diverse training

#### 1.3.3 Code Architecture

**Modular Design:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Distinct modules for models, training, evaluation, data
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized hyperparameter control
- **Reproducibility**: Fixed random seeds and deterministic training
- **Extensibility**: Easy to modify and extend components

### 1.4 Rationale for Design Choices

**Why Larger Architecture?**

- Paired images require understanding both individual objects and their relationships
- Larger models can learn more sophisticated visual representations

**Why Pre-norm Architecture?**
- Better gradient flow compared to post-norm
- More stable training, especially with deeper networks
- Standard practice in modern transformer implementations

**Why Data Augmentation?**
- Limited training data (50,000 CIFAR-100 images)
- Augmentation increases effective dataset size
- Improves generalization to unseen image variations
